# **Introduction**
This project is my 4th project in the 5 project course for Code Institute.

This was an idea I had in mind when I began to plan the project. I wanted to create a great website where users could upload and share their recipes that they considered divine.
I followed the Django Blog Tutorial from Code Institute course. I found going over the blog project great in building my confidence in working with Django.

The main requirement of this project was to build a Full Stack site based on business logic used to control a centrally-owned dataset. This required me as the developer to set up an authentication and provide role-based access to the site's data.

The Site is a great community platform where they can share their favourite dishes, they can also comment and give suggestions to other peoples recipes.


# **UX**
## **User Stories**
### **Users**
1. As a User I can look through a paginated list of recipes.
2. As a User I can click and see a users' recipes so that the User can expand their cooking knowledge
3. As a User I can upload my recipe so I can share it with other users
4. As a User I can upload images with my recipes so other users can see what the recipe will make
5. As a User I can see the comments and number of likes so that I can keep up with people's opinion about the post
6. As a User I can sign in and out of the my account safely and securely
7. As a User I can comment on posts so that I can interact with other Users
8. As a User I can see my login status so that I know if they are logged in or not
9. As a User I can like and unlike posts so I can intereact with the content
10. As a User I can create, read, update and delete posts so I can manage the content I create

### **Admin**
1. As an Admin I can filter, search and delete posts so that I can manage my website content.
2. As an Admin I can control what comments stay on posts so that I can filter out objectionable comments.

#### **Site Aims**

My main aim for the project was to create a site where the users could share their recipes with ease, as well as interact with other people interested in cooking. I wanted to create a community where people interested in cooking or learning to cook.

A user could also use the site to store their recipes for their own use in the future.

The website focuses on the following target audiences:

- **Demographic:**
    - Food loving people
    - People looking for more recipes to expand their food knowledge
    - Cooking enthusiasts

The website needs to enable the user to:
- Browse recipes
- Create and set up their account
- Create and upload their recipes
- Like and comment on a recipe

The website needs to enable the admin to:
- Approve recipe uploads and comments
- Filter through recipes, comments, and users to ease control of the site

#### **Scope**
A scope was defined to identify what needed to be done to align features with the strategy previously defined. Due to the imbalance of scores above, there will be some trade-offs. The was broken into these categories:

- **Content Requirements**
    
    - The UX *must* address these:
        - A comprehensive list of recipes.
        - A comprehensive set of instructions with ingredients to follow.
        - A list of all comments made on a recipe.
    - The UX *should* accommodate these:
        - Easy navigation of the site.
        - Ability to comment and like recipes.

## **Testing**
### **User Stories**
1. As a User I can look through a paginated list of recipes so that I can find a recipe that looks good to make.
    - If the number of recipes page exceeds the number of six then the remainder, starting with the oldest post, will be moved onto the next page. This will continue until there are six or fewer recipe cards on the front page.
2. As a site user/admin I can see the date a post was made so that I can keep up with the latest cooking trends.
    - On the recipe detail page below the image of the recipe, it shows the user when the post was uploaded and who it was uploaded by.
3. As a Site user I can click and load up other users' recipes to expand my cooking knowledge.
    - On each recipe card on the recipe page it tells the user the name of the recipe and who uploaded it. If the user clicks on the title then they will be directed to the recipe detail page where they will get all the information about that recipe.
4. As a site user I can upload a recipe so that I can share my ideas with other users. 
    - There is a separate page on the website that users can click on to which they will then have to fill out a form and submit it before it gets published.
5. As a Site user I can upload images with my recipes so that other users can see what the recipe will make.
    -  Once a recipe has been uploaded by a user the image they selected will be the face of the recipe card and on the recipe detail page. If they don't choose an image with their recipe then a placeholder is provided.
6. As a Site User/Admin I can see the number of likes and comments so that I can keep up with the conversation.
    - Next to the like button there is a number that indicates how many likes the recipe has gotten. (Should be noted that there is no number count for the number of comments on the recipe. I ran out of time for the project before I could implement it)
7. As a Site User I can keep my account login information hidden so that my account will be restricted to just me.
    - When creating an account and filling out the password, the password is protected by asterisks. Users can also log out to prevent anyone from using their account.
8. As a Site User I can sign in and out of my account so that I can protect my account when I am not using it. 
    - there are separate pages for logging in and out.
9. As a Site User I can create and maintain an account so that I can create my post and interact with others.
    - The user can create an account and manage all of their posts on the user recipe page which can be accessed through the recipe page.
10. As a Site user I can comment on posts so that I can interact with the content.
    - Underneath the image and recipe info on recipe detail is a comment section that showcases all comments made on the recipe and a comment form that can only be accessed by registered users.
11. As a Site user I can see my login status so that I know if I am logged in or not.
    - The user will know if they are logged in because the navigation bar will tell them to log out rather than log in. When logged in users use the home page the main title on the page greets them with the username that they selected when creating the account.
12. As a Site User I can like and unlike posts/comments so that I can interact with the content.
    - A user that is registered and logged in can like and unlike a recipe on the recipe detail page.
13. As a Site User / Admin I can create, read, update and delete posts so that I can manage my blog content.
    - Both admin and user can create, read and update posts on the site.
### **Manual Testing**

#### **Common Elements Testing**
- Navigation works on every page.
- All social links in the footer open a new page following the correct link.

#### **Page Testing**
- Once logged in, the navigation login changes to logout.
- Links to Create recipe and Recipe page on the home page work/
- All recipe cards have clickable links that direct the users to the recipe detail page featuring all the information they need. 
- The edit and delete buttons that are available to a user if they are logged in and are the ones who created the recipe all work and will direct them to the correct page.
- The my recipes page brings the user to my-recipes page and shows only their recipes.
- The comment form and submit button work and once submitted an alert pops up where the comment form was to tell users their comment has been published.
- The login, logout and signup pages work with no issues.
- The categories when clicked will direct users to the correct page.

### **Automated Testing**
The [W3C Markup Validator](https://validator.w3.org/ "Link to MÂ£C Markup Validator Site") service was used to validate the `HTML` and `CSS` code used. The [PEP8 Python Validator](http://pep8online.com/ "Link to the PEP8 Python Validator Site") was used to validate the `Python` code used.

- HTML pages - Code Validation - all HTML pages clear.

- CSS Stylesheet - CSS tested with no errors.


#### **User Testing** 
I asked fellow users on slack to test out my project and listened to any problems they had with the site.

I also asked my family to test it on several different devices and browsers and changed anything that they found wrong with the site.

#### **Browser Validation**
I tested my project on both chrome and safari.

## **Deploymemt**

This project was developed using a [GitPod](https://gitpod.io/ "Link to GitPod") workspace. The code was committed to [Git](https://git-scm.com/ "Link to Git") and pushed to [GitHub](https://github.com/ "Link to GitHub") using the terminal.

### Deploying on Heroku
To deploy this page to Heroku from its GitHub repository, the following steps were taken:

1. Create the Heroku App:
    - Select "Create new app" in Heroku.
    - Choose a name for your app and select the location.

2. Attach the Postgres database:
    - In the Resources tab, under add-ons, type in Postgres and select the Heroku Postgres option.

3. Prepare the environment and settings.py file:
    - In the Settings tab, click on Reveal Config Vars and copy the url next to DATABASE_URL.
    - In your GitPod workspace, create an env.py file in the main directory. 
    - Add the DATABASE_URL value and your chosen SECRET_KEY value to the env.py file.
    - Add the SECRET_KEY value to the Config Vars in Heroku.
    - Update the settings.py file to import the env file and add the SECRETKEY and DATABASE_URL file paths.
    - Update the Config Vars with the Cloudinary url, adding into the settings.py file also.
    - In settings.py add the following sections:
        - Cloudinary to the INSTALLED_APPS list
        - STATICFILE_STORAGE
        - STATICFILES_DIRS
        - STATIC_ROOT
        - MEDIA_URL
        - DEFAULT_FILE_STORAGE
        - TEMPLATES_DIR
        - Update DIRS in TEMPLATES with TEMPLATES_DIR
        - Update ALLOWED_HOSTS with ['app_name.heroku.com', 'localhost']

4. Store Static and Media files in Cloudinary and Deploy to Heroku:
    - Create three directories in the main directory; media, storage, and templates.
    - Create a file named "Procfile" in the main directory and add the following:
        - web: gunicorn project-name.WSGI
    - Log in to Heroku using the terminal Heroku login -i.
    - Then run the following command: **heroku git:remote -a your_app_name_here** and replace your_app_name_here with the name of your Heroku app. This will link the app to your Gitpod terminal.
    - After linking your app to your workspace, you can then deploy new versions of the app by running the command **git push heroku main** and your app will be deployed to Heroku.
