This project was developed using a [GitPod](https://gitpod.io/ "Link to GitPod") workspace. The code was committed to [Git](https://git-scm.com/ "Link to Git") and pushed to [GitHub](https://github.com/ "Link to GitHub") using the terminal.

### Deploying on Heroku
To deploy this page to Heroku from its GitHub repository, the following steps were taken:

1. Create the Heroku App:
    - Select "Create new app" in Heroku.
    - Choose a name for your app and select the location.

2. Attach the Postgres database:
    - In the Resources tab, under add-ons, type in Postgres and select the Heroku Postgres option.

3. Prepare the environment and settings.py file:
    - In the Settings tab, click on Reveal Config Vars and copy the url next to DATABASE_URL.
    - In your GitPod workspace, create an env.py file in the main directory. 
    - Add the DATABASE_URL value and your chosen SECRET_KEY value to the env.py file.
    - Add the SECRET_KEY value to the Config Vars in Heroku.
    - Update the settings.py file to import the env file and add the SECRETKEY and DATABASE_URL file paths.
    - Update the Config Vars with the Cloudinary url, adding into the settings.py file also.
    - In settings.py add the following sections:
        - Cloudinary to the INSTALLED_APPS list
        - STATICFILE_STORAGE
        - STATICFILES_DIRS
        - STATIC_ROOT
        - MEDIA_URL
        - DEFAULT_FILE_STORAGE
        - TEMPLATES_DIR
        - Update DIRS in TEMPLATES with TEMPLATES_DIR
        - Update ALLOWED_HOSTS with ['app_name.heroku.com', 'localhost']

4. Store Static and Media files in Cloudinary and Deploy to Heroku:
    - Create three directories in the main directory; media, storage, and templates.
    - Create a file named "Procfile" in the main directory and add the following:
        - web: gunicorn project-name.WSGI
    - Log in to Heroku using the terminal Heroku login -i.
    - Then run the following command: **heroku git:remote -a your_app_name_here** and replace your_app_name_here with the name of your Heroku app. This will link the app to your Gitpod terminal.
    - After linking your app to your workspace, you can then deploy new versions of the app by running the command **git push heroku main** and your app will be deployed to Heroku.
